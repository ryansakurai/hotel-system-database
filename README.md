# Database Systems Project

This is a database for a system of hotels I projected for a university group project, using PostgreSQL. It involved:
- creating relational schema;
- creating queries;
- analyzing queries' execution through EXPLAIN ANALYZE;
- trying to optimize the queries;
- populating the database;
- avoiding SQLi;
- implementing user access control.

## Organization
